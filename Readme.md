> This project was initially created due to the lack of fast shutdown-access on Windows 8. As this is no longer the case for newer Windows-Versions there should not be a need for this application anymore.

# pw-shutdown

This small taskbar application enables *fast* access to windows shutdown options. It creates jump-list items for shutdown, restart, sleep and logoff and opens up the shutdown dialog window on default start. 

**It uses the localized windows default strings.**

Now there's a port to c++ to get around the .NET sturtup delay and extremly speedup the applications start.
